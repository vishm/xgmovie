##Introduction

A simple Asp.Net Web API 2 application that carries out lookup on https://www.themoviedb.org/ to retrieve various meta data.

##Aims

Capture various notes for myself in developing these style of apps, including:
* Composing app via IoC
* Testability of various layers
* Well defined REST endpoints & return information
* Secure storing config data such as API key
* Improve upon hardcoded absolute path to secrets.
* Mapping from user data/public to internal structures (todo)
* Persistant (todo)
* Cloud hosting (todo)
* Web page that renders information stored (todo)
